## About
This project is part of the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Odin Project</a>'s foundations course, which I undertook in order to increase my skill level in modern web development.

For this project I created a Rock Paper Scissors Game using the WebStack (HTML, CSS, JS).
